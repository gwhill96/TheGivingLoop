  <h2 class="section-title">Why We Exist</h2>
  <p class="body-text">
    In Q1 2022, 4.9m fewer people in the UK donated to charity compared to the same months in 2019... and here are some reasons why....
    <ul class="body-text">
    <li>people don’t donate because they don’t believe that organisations make a positive difference</li>
    <li>people don’t donate because they believe their donation is too small to make a difference</li>
    <li>people don’t donate because they don’t trust philanthropic organisations</li>
    <p>We have a vision to remove these barriers through a donation model that enables you to donate <strong>TANGIBLE</strong> things and <strong>RECEIVE A NOTIFICATION</strong> once they are redeemed!</p>
    </ul>
