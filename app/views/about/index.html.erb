  <p class="body-text">
    The Giving Loop is on a mission to close the feedback loop on charitable donations
  </p>
  <h2 class="section-title">Why We Exist</h2>
  <p class="body-text">
    In Q1 2022, 4.9m fewer people in the UK donated to charity compared to the same months in 2019... and here are some reasons why....
    <ul class="body-text">
    <li>people don’t donate is because they don’t believe that organisations make a positive difference</li>
    <li>people don’t donate is because they believe their donation is too small to make a difference</li>
    <li>people don’t donate is because they don’t trust philanthropic organisations</li>
    <li>We have a vision to remove these barriers through a donation model that enables you to donate TANGIBLE things and RECEIVE A NOTIFICATION once they are redeemed!</li>
    </ul>
